Everything about this repository is a mess, I'm sorry.\
It serves mainly to teach myself 3D and how to use assimp to extract models from a game.\
Also if I can insert Dana fully animated in ToCS 4 that would be great. 

So far:\
Textures should be OK. \
The model itself should be OK.\
UV maps: I know where the wrapping method is (in the material parameters) I just didnt take the time to explore all of the possibilities\
Bones should be OK.\
Animation: Position and scaling are OK, rotation is not OK.

If I ever figure out how the rotations work, I will clean up the code. Right now it's in research state.\
You can contact me if you want to contribute to this research/have advice in general at feitaishi45@gmail.com

Thanks to uyjulian for the help
